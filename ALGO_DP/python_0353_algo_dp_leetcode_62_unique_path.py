A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?

ANALYSIS


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1) How to define the dp function? / What's the meaning of the dp array? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Q: How many possible unique paths are there?
Parameterzied the Q: How many possible unique paths are there when the robot is at row n and column m?

f(m,n):
param m : row m
param n : column n
f(m,n)  : total unique path

dp = [i][j]:
index i : row i
index j : column j
dp[i][j]  : total unique path

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2) What's the base case? / How to initialize the dp array?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
dp = np.full([m,n], -1, dtype=np.int32)

[base case]
dp[1] = 1 
dp[:,1] = 1

because, for the 1st column & 1st row, there is only 1 unique path.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3) What's the state transition? From THE problem to subproblem?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the robot can ony move rightwards and downwards, so for position dp[i][j], the value is:
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
